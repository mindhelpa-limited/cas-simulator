    "candidateInstructions": "You are working in liaison psychiatry and have assessed Mr Septimus Harding, a 63-year-old man on the cardiology ward. He had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) three weeks ago, and the ward staff are concerned that he is not making sufficient progress.\nHe describes feeling ‘really rubbish’ ever since his heart attack, having previously felt very positive and carefree – he was particularly looking forward to retirement. He lacks the energy to make progress with his cardiac rehabilitation even though the doctors tell him that his heart is doing well. He said that ‘all the fun just seemed to be sucked out of life’. His real passion in life was music, but he can’t have his cello on the ward to play.\nHis mood just seems to be getting worse. He tends to wake up at 4:00 A.M., but he’s not sure if that’s just the beeping from all the machines. He has lost his interest in food and just eats because the nurses tell him he has to; he doesn’t like the hospital food anyway. He thinks he has lost a bit of weight.\nHe tells you that he feels very guilty about his wife having to travel up to the hospital so often. He thinks that the NSTEMI is all his own fault because he has never been a person who exercises much. He is worried that he might lose his job.\n● Previous medical history: Essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes\n● Current medication: Amlodipine 10 mg OD, metformin MR 1 g OD, aspirin 75 mg OD, clopidogrel 75 mg OD, atorvastatin 80 mg OD, bisoprolol 2.5 mg OD\n● Social history: Lives with his wife in a flat; has a difficult relationship with his daughter, as she doesn’t like her husband; works as a salesman\n● Substance use: Has not drunk anything since being admitted to the hospital, but used to drink three to five pints of beer each night; used to smoke 30 cigarettes per day but has been told he should quit; has never used recreational drugs\n● Risk: Denies any thoughts of ending his life or harming others, no previous history of other relevant risk behaviours\nThere is currently a bright young medical student in your team, Henrietta Lacks. The consultant has asked you to present the case to her as a teaching opportunity.\nPresent the case to the medical student and answer her questions. Explain the most likely diagnosis and discuss an appropriate management plan.",
    "actorInstructions": "You are Henrietta Lacks, a medical student in a liaison psychiatry team. It has been arranged that the doctor in front of you is going to teach you about an interesting case. The case regards a person whom the doctor recently assessed, who had become very low in mood following a heart attack (you should ideally say ‘myocardial infarction’, which means the same thing). Time is limited, so if the doctor is taking a very long time (e.g. two to three minutes) answering one question and you think they will run out of time before answering them all, try to move them on to another. Your questions are as follows:\n1. Ask the doctor to summarise the case.\n2. Ask whether there is any additional information they would like to know. If they need prompting, ask whether there is anybody else it could be helpful to speak to, as you’ve often seen other doctors do this.\n3. Ask what they think the most likely diagnosis is, and whether there are other possibilities. Keep this relatively brief.\n4. Ask for their treatment plan. If they do not cover each of biological (e.g. medications, alcohol reduction), psychological (e.g. a ‘talking therapy’ such as cognitive behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy), and social factors (e.g. peer support, sick note for employer), then encourage them to consider those they have missed (e.g. ‘Is there anything psychological that could be done to help?’). If they do not cover short- and long-term management, encourage them to consider both (e.g. ‘What about in the longer term?’).\nEncourage the candidate to be specific. If they mention antidepressant medication, ask them which one(s) and why. If they mention psychological therapy, ask which modality (i.e. type) they would consider.",

      "Knowledge": "The candidate successfully identifies that this is a case of (mild to moderate) depression following a myocardial infarction. Differential diagnoses would include an adjustment disorder, an anxiety disorder, or (less likely) alcohol dependence/withdrawal associated with low mood, but the main task is to identify the depression.",
      "Management": "The candidate considers sources of further information (collateral history from wife, nurses, medical notes). They devise an individualised management plan covering a biopsychosocial strategy in the short and long term. Biological: Considers appropriate SSRIs (e.g., sertraline) while noting contraindications (citalopram), medication interactions, and lifestyle support (diet, smoking, alcohol). Psychological: Suggests appropriate therapies (e.g., guided self-help, CBT, IPT) and addresses specific cognitions (guilt). Social: Considers environmental changes (side room), support networks (peer support, family), and practical help (sick note, music).",
      "Communication": "Candidate presents the case to the student clearly and logically, avoiding jargon. They structure their answers to the student's questions effectively, creating a positive teaching environment.

She was switched from aripiprazole to haloperidol three weeks ago, but she is now ‘non-adherent’ with her medication, stating that it is ‘driving her mad’. Your colleague has been unable to convince her to take the medication.\nPlease explore Mrs Achebe’s concerns regarding her current medication; once you have identified her main concern, please attempt to explore possible solutions.",
    "actorInstructions": "You are 31-year-old Mrs Agatha Achebe. You have been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia since you were 23, and this is your second inpatient admission. Due to concerns that aripiprazole was not fully controlling your symptoms, you have been switched to haloperidol. The dosage has been steadily increased to 15 mg over 24 hours and has been effective, insofar as you are free of psychotic symptoms.\nUnfortunately, over the last few days you have noticed that you are struggling with a feeling of ‘ants in your pants’; you are unable to sit still for more than 10 minutes at a time before a horrible feeling of tension and restlessness (mainly in your legs) compels you to get up and move. This sensation is at its worst when you are having to stand still (e.g. when queueing for medication). Subjectively, you feel anxious, tense, and generally ‘awful’ (in a way that you struggle to put into words). During your discussion with the doctor, you struggle to sit still at all and feel the urge to pace, cross your legs, and roll on the balls of your feet. At times, you must stand up, walk a few steps, and sit back down again. You have no feelings of stiffness, tremor, or other EPSEs.\nThis feeling is getting in the way of your ability to sleep, eat, and enjoy anything in life. You were worried you were relapsing, but this feels very different.\nIf asked directly, you cannot imagine continuing like this, and if there is no way of getting rid of this feeling, you are confident you would not want to live anymore. Presently, you do not have any active desire or plans to take your own life.\nYou are otherwise managing well on the ward and are keen to ensure your mental illness is well managed with a medication you can take in the longer term. You have no other psychiatric symptomatology (no depressive, anxious, or psychotic symptoms), and you have no plans to harm others.\nYour main concern is that you are taken seriously, and that your doctor will work with you to help find an appropriate solution.\nIf you feel that you are being dismissed, or that the doctor is only concerned with ensuring you take your medication as prescribed, you will become irritable and withdrawn, hoping to discuss this with the consultant as opposed to the doctor in front of you.",

      "Communication": "A key task in this station is to quickly form a collaborative relationship with the patient. The candidate does not minimise the side effects reported and avoids ‘convincing’ the patient to continue with the current treatment.

You first became aware of this when he expressed concerns over missing various minor appointments; you initially dismissed this as part of getting older. However, recently he has been forgetting where he is and getting lost in previously familiar places.\nHe lives with your mother, who is fit and well. She has also noticed that your father has not been ‘quite right’ for some time. She recently told you that he has been struggling to ‘get the right words out’ and no longer takes pride in his appearance – often going unshaven for several days and buttoning up his shirt incorrectly.\nYour father used to be an accountant and managed the family’s finances smoothly. Recently, he has been forgetting to pay bills, and you have now stepped in to help. You put this down to his difficulty with paying things online and modern technology, although you are aware this is not very plausible as your father has been using the internet for more than 20 years and ran his own business successfully.\nYour father does not take any medications, has no known health conditions, and has not had any recent infections or medical procedures. He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke.\nIf asked, there has not been a change in his personality, and he has not been rude, been impulsive, or behaved oddly.\nIf asked, there has been no fluctuation to his symptoms, just a steady decline.\nIf asked, he has not had any visual hallucinations.\nHe has never seen a psychiatrist before, and there is no relevant family history that you can think of.",

You recently assessed Ruby in the outpatient clinic following a GP referral for a possible eating disorder.\nAt the initial assessment, you learnt that Ruby had been a very active adolescent. She played hockey regularly for a local team and also enjoyed cycling and swimming. However, during the first few months of university, she spent a lot of time socialising and eating takeaway meals with her new friends. Consequently, she noticed she had started putting on weight.\nRuby had always thought of herself as slim, and the sudden weight gain made her feel very uncomfortable. As a result, she started to monitor her diet and began counting calories. She acknowledged that this had become more of a preoccupation over the last few months and agreed that she had lost a considerable amount of weight.\nRuby admits that she has also started exercising again, but not for enjoyment – rather, for fear of putting on weight again.\nRuby denied any self-induced vomiting or the use of either laxatives or diet pills.\nRuby currently lives at home with her parents. She has taken time off her university course with the agreement of her academic tutor, who was concerned about the amount of weight she had lost.\nPertinent Investigations\nECG – Nil acute pathology detected\nBlood tests – All within normal range except white cell count (WCC) of 3.2 × 10⁹/L [ref range: 4 – 11.0]\nBlood pressure – 95/70 mmHg, Heart rate – 60 bpm\nBMI – 15 kg/m²\nYou have diagnosed Ruby with anorexia nervosa. She recognises she has a problem with her eating; however, she is apprehensive about treatment and the prospect of gaining weight.\nRuby has consented for you to share information from her initial assessment with her mother.\nDiscuss Ruby’s diagnosis with her mother and answer any questions she may have.",
    "actorInstructions": "You are Mrs Jane Belfield, the mother of 18-year-old Ruby. Ruby has returned home early from her first year at university after some concerns about stress and weight loss. When you came to pick her up a few weeks ago, you were shocked to see how much weight she had lost.\nSince returning home, Ruby has told you about her recent diagnosis of anorexia. You have heard a little about this diagnosis but would like more information. You are frightened she will not get better, as you know that anorexia can cause death.\nIf the candidate explains things in a non-judgemental way and appears understanding, you explain that you are concerned that your own adolescent issues with eating may have somehow been passed on to your daughter, even though you have always been careful not to discuss weight or diet with her.\nRuby is your only child, and you want to help Ruby in any way possible.\nThe specific questions you’d like answered are as follows:\nWhat is anorexia?\nWhy do people develop anorexia?\nWhat treatment is available?\nCan people fully recover?\nHow can the family best support Ruby?",

George is a 32-year-old man with moderate learning disability and has lived at the care home for around five years. You have been George’s key worker for the past two years. You are eager to speak to the doctor about George’s presentation.\nYou have noticed that in the last six weeks, George has become more withdrawn, less happy, and less verbally communicative. He has been isolating himself in his bedroom, rather than spending time in the communal areas of the care home as he used to. He has even stopped coming to the dining room for meals, causing some concerning weight loss. He has also stopped going to the day centre that he used to enjoy attending twice a week. You and your colleagues have noticed he is not sleeping as well at night, and is often found crying in the middle of the night.\nIf asked, he doesn’t seem to really enjoy anything at all at present.\nIf asked, he has not been observed to be responding to voices or visual hallucinations or presented with any other bizarre behaviour.\nThere has also been one episode of aggression, where George hit out at a staff member when prompted to come out of his room. George was very distressed, and two staff members were needed to de-escalate his behaviour. You are concerned that another episode like this could occur unpredictably and about George’s risk of injury to staff. He has also been observed to bang his head on the wall on a number of occasions, albeit sustaining no injuries as a result. He does not do anything else that might hurt himself, and he has never expressed suicidal thoughts. He does not have a history of suicide attempts.\nIf asked, you have not noticed any suspicious bruises on George’s body, and you are unaware of any reports of abuse at the care home.\nYou are baffled by this change, as George has always been a happy, cheerful man. He is well liked and interacts well with staff and other residents.\nYou understand George to have an IQ of 41. He is able to verbally communicate with very basic skills in English. He can carry out basic self-care tasks with support from staff. You think his learning disability may have a genetic cause, but you do not know more specific details. He does not have an established diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although not formally diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, he exhibits autistic traits in line with his moderate level of learning disability. He does not have a history of seizures.\nIf asked about physical health, you know that George was reviewed two days ago by the local GP, who found he was severely constipated and has prescribed him laxatives. He has yet to pass faeces. No other health problems were identified. You do not think there are any problems with his memory recently.\nIf asked about visitors or relatives, you have noticed that George’s mother has been visiting the care home less often recently due to increased work commitments – from once a week to once a month.

    "actorInstructions": "You are Ms Lizzie Eustace, a 22-year-old unemployed woman who has dropped out of university. You feel fed up with the hospital and want to go home. You do not see why you have to speak to yet another doctor. You will only be persuaded to discuss more about yourself if the doctor is respectful and explains why it is important to speak to them.\nThis morning, you had an argument with your boyfriend, Freddie, on the phone. He accused you of flirting with another guy, when actually you were just being friendly. Freddie shouted at you, and you yelled back at him, ‘Get out of my life!’ You then drank half a bottle of wine and took the paracetamol tablets that you had in the cupboard. You wanted to end your life at the time and thought that you had nothing left to live for.\nYou then called an ambulance a half hour later because you didn’t want to die and you were worried about your cats if you did. You shouted at the paramedics because one of them rolled their eyes at you. You now feel okay and just want to go home. You no longer wish to end your life.\nYou have taken several overdoses in the past, sometimes paracetamol, sometimes ibuprofen. You have also self-harmed for years by cutting yourself with a razor blade to cut your arms; this relieves some of the frustration you often experience.\nYour mood seems to go up and down all the time (within a few minutes); even things like being stood up by a friend can make you want to end your life. You think of yourself as pretty worthless. You get angry with yourself and with others a lot. You always seem to be getting into arguments with other people and you don’t know why. With a previous boyfriend, you’d sometimes hit each other during these arguments, but nobody got hurt.\nYour mother always used to say that you have ‘no sticking power’, and you know that you give up on things easily. You tend to do things on the spur of the moment and then regret them afterward, like when you saw a necklace you liked in a store and stole it; this led to a police caution.\nYou have dropped out of university and don’t know what to do with your time now.\nYou have had a series of short-term relationships. To start with, the guy seems like the best person in the world – really kind and sympathetic – but after a few weeks, you inevitably find out that he is an idiot. There seems to be a pattern – you can’t live with them and you can’t live without them. You always worry that they’re going to leave you, but you can’t stand them when they’re around.\nYou know you drink quite a lot of alcohol, binging on bottles of wine three to four times a week. You’ve experimented with cannabis, ecstasy, and ‘meow meow’, but you’ve never injected drugs.\nYou don’t hear voices, but you do sometimes worry that people are ‘out to get you’, though you know they’re not really.\nIf asked, as a child, your mother died and your father neglected you.

Mrs Connolly has expressed some concerns about her son’s behaviour toward the surgical team, who have requested a psychiatric review.\nSpeak to Mrs Connolly to obtain a collateral history, considering differential diagnoses and addressing her concerns.",
    "actorInstructions": "You are Mrs Sue Connolly, the mother of 27-year-old Steven Connolly, who was involved in a road traffic accident four days ago. He was knocked off his motorbike and sustained multiple injuries, including three broken ribs, a broken arm, and multiple wounds on his legs and face. Your understanding is that he was knocked unconscious during the accident and only regained consciousness the day after he was admitted to the hospital. He was in the ITU for the first 24 hours of his admission, after which he was transferred to the surgical ward, where he has since undergone successful surgery on his broken arm.\nYou are worried about Steven, as since waking up he seems ‘different’. He keeps asking for his girlfriend, from whom he separated a number of months back, and is repeatedly getting agitated about a job he must finish at work (which you have since been informed by his colleagues was completed last month). His mood has been quite ‘up and down’, and he is quite irritable, which is unusual for him as he has always been a very gentle person. A particular cause for upset and embarrassment is that you have heard him on a number of occasions make sexually inappropriate comments to some of the nursing staff, which is very out of character. At first, you had put this behaviour down to the trauma, or the effects of medication, but things have not improved in several days. You are worried that his change in behaviour is due to something more serious, and you fear that it is permanent.\nIf asked, you have noticed him struggling to hold a conversation or focus on any entertainment since his accident because his attention span seems so poor. He seems to you to have lost his sense of humour as he fails to understand jokes, and he sometimes laughs hysterically for no obvious reason.\nYou are aware that Steven had a brain scan upon arrival at the hospital, and there were no obvious abnormalities detected. He has not had a repeat brain scan since. He has no physical health problems and no other history of significant head injuries. He used to smoke cannabis as an adolescent but no longer does; you’re not aware of any other illicit substance use. You are aware he drinks socially but are not sure of the frequency or amount.

    "actorInstructions": "You are Mrs Jane Cooper. You have an appointment at the child and adolescent mental health clinic regarding your son Harry, who is presently at school. You appear anxious, as you are worried about the difficulty your son is having at school and the impact his behaviour may have on his academic achievement and future.\nHarry is in Year 8. Since he started secondary school last year, you have received numerous reports from schoolteachers about Harry’s ‘challenging behaviour’. Teachers complain about him not listening in class, being too easily distracted, and shouting out when it is not his turn to speak. During classes, he gets up from his seat repeatedly and sometimes leaves the classroom without the teacher’s permission. Teachers have warned you he is disrupting other students’ learning with his behaviour, and he is put in detention multiple times per week. Similar issues were reported at Harry’s primary school, but things are far worse at secondary school – you suspect because he is being expected to sit down and concentrate for longer periods. Harry was usually regarded as average in academic ability at school, but he has been moved down to the lower-ability classes this academic year.\nHarry has insisted to you that he tries his best at school but finds it hard to concentrate. He frequently forgets what homework he has been set. He finds it embarrassing to have fallen behind his peers academically and has started to dread attending school due to the criticism and punishment from teachers for his behaviour.\nYou had a normal pregnancy with Harry, although he was born four weeks prematurely via emergency Caesarean section. Harry was always a hyperactive and energetic child. He has a tendency to talk and act without fully thinking things through, which can get him into trouble. He often acts quickly and sincerely apologises a few minutes later. He can’t concentrate on anything at home for more than 15 minutes. Harry has no physical health problems. He has no history of misusing drugs or alcohol. He has no specific learning difficulties, including no difficulties with reading; no difficulties with communication/social interaction; and no restrictive interests or repetitive behaviours. He has never had much of a problem doing as he is told, and he has no history of involvement with the police. You and Harry’s father can lose your temper with him when he doesn’t listen or sit still, but are not physically punitive.\nYour biggest fear is that Harry might end up excluded from school if this behaviour continues.

A stranger called an ambulance, which took you to the ED. You are now on a surgical ward and the ‘bone doctors’ have told you that you need an operation as soon as possible because the part of the hip that has broken is very important. They said the fracture would not heal properly without it, and mentioned something about the blood in your leg being affected. The surgeons did talk to you about the risks of the operation – you remember them mentioning pain and bleeding.\nYou do not want the surgery and strongly believe that God will help heal the fracture. You are very religious and have been praying all night for God to help heal the fracture.

You initially became suspicious of her infidelity six months ago when you smelt men’s aftershave on her coat as she returned home from work. Since this time, you have noticed Carol flirting with nearly every man she meets. For example, earlier today you overheard her saying good morning to the postal carrier in what you describe as a ‘seductive’ manner.

You have confronted Carol about your suspicions on several occasions, which invariably resulted in heated arguments. She has repeatedly denied the affairs; however, you are still convinced she is being unfaithful and have made the decision to obtain a confession from her ‘one way or another’. If pushed to specify what you mean, you disclose that you are prepared to use physical force and have been researching injectable ‘truth serums’ on the internet.\nIf asked, despite being suspicious of every man Carol comes in contact with, you have no intention to approach nor harm any of the suspected lovers.\nYou deny feeling depressed and describe your mood as ‘stressed’. You have no thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation and deny ever experiencing hallucinations. You have never seen a psychiatrist before.\nYou have not been sleeping well and have started calling in sick to work in order to dedicate time to gather further evidence of the affair.
